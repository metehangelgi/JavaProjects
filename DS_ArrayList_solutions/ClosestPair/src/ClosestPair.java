/*
 * File: ClosestPair.java
 * ----------------------
 * The data file �Heights.txt� contains the heights of students in a                                                     
 * class in centimeters (one height per line, each height expressed as                                                   
 * a double).  Write a program that reads the numbers in this file                                                       
 * into an ArrayList and finds the pair of numbers that are closest to                                                   
 * each other.  The program should print out which two numbers are                                                       
 * closest and what their difference is.  It should work for any file                                                    
 * containing a number on each line.
